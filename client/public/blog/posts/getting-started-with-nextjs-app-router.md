Next.js has revolutionized the way we build React applications with its hybrid static and server rendering capabilities. The App Router introduced in Next.js 13 brings a new paradigm to routing and rendering in Next.js applications.

## Understanding the App Router

The App Router uses a file-system based router built on top of Server Components. It supports layouts, nested routing, loading states, error handling, and more.

## Key Features

* **Server Components**: Components that render on the server, reducing client-side JavaScript.
* **Nested Layouts**: Create UI that is shared across routes with nested layouts.
* **Loading States**: Create loading UI for specific route segments.
* **Error Handling**: Capture errors at the route level.

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js project with the App Router, use the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --use-npm
```

This will set up a new Next.js project with the App Router configuration already in place.

## Building Your First Route

In the App Router, routes are defined by folders within the app directory, and the route's UI is defined by a page.js file within that folder.

For example, to create a route for /dashboard, you would create the following structure:

```
app/
 └── dashboard/
     └── page.js
```

And the page.js file could contain a simple React component:

```jsx
export default function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Dashboard</h1>
      <p>Welcome to your dashboard!</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Using Images in Your Blog

<div className="my-8">
  <img

    alt="Next.js App Router Diagram" 
    className="rounded-lg shadow-md mx-auto" 
    width="600" 
    height="400"
  />
  <p className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">Next.js App Router Architecture</p>
</div>

You can also use standard markdown for images:

## Mixing HTML and Markdown

You can mix HTML and markdown as needed. For example:

<div className="bg-blue-50 p-4 my-4 rounded-lg border border-blue-200">
  <h3 className="text-blue-700 font-semibold">Pro Tip</h3>
  <p>Use Server Components for content that doesn't need interactivity for better performance.</p>
</div>

## Conclusion

The App Router in Next.js 13+ provides a powerful and flexible way to build modern web applications. With server components, layouts, and other features, it enables developers to create performant and maintainable applications with ease.
